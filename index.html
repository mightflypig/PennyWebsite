						<h2>What is strengths coaching?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Strengths coaching is all about unlocking your inner potential by identifying<br />
                            and developing your personal strengths. The coaching is personalized to your unique<br />
                            strengths to help you understand how you are wired and use that to maximize your life!<br />
                            <br />
                            Using the Clifton StrengthsFinder tools Penny empowers you to discover your areas of talent <br />
                            and helps you to effectively understand, develop and maximise these areas so they become strengths.<br />
                            <br />
                            The first step is to complete the Gallup online Strengths Finder assessment, which is comprised of <br />
                            180 questions. This will identify your Top 5 strengths and Penny will then personally coach you, <br />
                            helping you understand each of these strengths to a greater extent and showing you how they can be <br />
                            used together to help you to flourish and achieve maximum results in every area of your life.
                        </p>

								<p><b>Maja</b> - <i>Senior Pastor and PhD Student</i></p>
                                <h4></h4>
								<p>I found my coaching session with Penny to be both informative and fun; she helped me to understand my individual strengths and how they play off one another, bringing powerful insight into what have been some long-term struggles in my life and leadership. I came away with a greater insight about how to develop my own strengths, as well as some significant actions points to apply. It’s also been helpful in understanding the dynamics of our leadership team, what strengths each person brings to the table and how we can better work together. Highly recommended!</p>

								<p><b>Sarah</b> - <i>Deputy Principal</i></p>
								<p>The Strengthsfinder assessment was really fun to do and it was great to be able to talk to Penny and gain an understanding of what my strengths are. I like the way all the attributes are seen in a positive light, yet there are aspects to watch out for in every strength, until they are developed to maturity.</p>
                                <p>Understanding my strengths has helped me in my work situation as a Teacher and Deputy Principal, to see why my perspective and priorities differ from those of my colleagues. It used to feel like conflict, or that I clashed with a workmate, but I now see it as different strengths approaching a problem in unique ways, which can result in a wider field of possibilities.</p>

								<p><b>Ella</b> - <i>Speech Language Therapist</i></p>
								<p>The coaching I received from Penny was phenomenal - finding out my strengths gave me the vocab to talk about myself in a new way. But receiving the coaching truly took it to the next level; like learning to speak a whole new language. It was so valuable to know how my strengths operate in beneficial ways and also learn to identify when they are operating in a counterproductive way. It was wonderful to get more insight about how my strengths interact together and how they affect my interactions within the work context.</p>

								<p>Penny is an inspiring Strengths Finder coach who made it easy for me to discover more about my own strengths and how I can use them to impact those around me. She provided practical strategies and advice on how to use my strengths on a daily basis. I felt encouraged and motivated by the way that she coached me. </p>
